## 1. Project Summary

The objective of this project was to develop an application to manage a restaurant.

The tasks that we get the app to handle are the generation of orders, notification of orders ready to serve, as well as organization of workers and products; each of these layouts is only accessible to those with the appropriate permissions based on their role in the business.

To make the mentioned functionalities possible, we consumed data from a RESTful API mock and developed its CRUD, using `React`.

## 2. Inspiration and Design

We start the design process searching and reviewing the web apps of various fast-food restaurants for inspiration.

The color pallette choosen, according to users, it's associated with the field of restaurants, food, and even the sensation of hunger.

Being an app developed as SPA (Mobile First), prioritizing its use in tablet-type devices, we considered the legibility of the text, without leaving behind the style of the later, the size of the buttons and inputs, and the intuitiveness of its navigation.

## 3. User Stories

A total of eight user stories were written

### 1. Login

The final functional version of this app can be visited [here](https://burgerqueen-bq2.netlify.app/)

## 5. Unit Tests

For the unit test in this project, we started to get acquainted with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). For this reason, we only test the login layout in this iteration of the project.
